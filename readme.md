> **SUPPORT NOTICE**

> Shopkit v1.0.4 is mainly a bug-fixing and security release, with a few new features but nothing wildly different.

> Part of the reason for this approach is that I will not be able to respond to support requests until **mid-June 2016**.

> I know this is not an ideal situation, but it's never a convenient time to go backpacking without internet access.

## Roadmap

Keep tabs on the [issues page](https://github.com/samnabi/shopkit/issues) to see what's planned for the future. Please add a new issue to report any bugs or request new features.

## Pricing

You can try Shopkit for free on your local machine or a test server, forever. Once you're satisfied, [buy a Shopkit license for $19 USD](http://shopkit.samnabi.com) to use it on a public site.

Since Shopkit runs on the Kirby CMS, you'll also have to buy a [Kirby license](http://getkirby.com/license) from Bastian.

## Installation

Shopkit, just like Kirby, does not require a database, which makes it very easy to install. Just copy the files to your server and visit the URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been copied to your server correctly**

### Download ZIP

Download the latest version of Shopkit from the [releases page](https://github.com/samnabi/shopkit/releases).

### Clone with Git

If you are familiar with the terminal, you can clone Shopkit from GitHub.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/samnabi/shopkit.git
    
### Update

Use these terminal commands to update Shopkit and all its dependencies to the latest commit in the `master` branch.

    # Update dependencies
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    git submodule foreach --recursive git checkout master
    git submodule foreach --recursive git pull
    
    # Update Shopkit
    git checkout master
    git pull


## Configuration

Most of Shopkit's configuration happens in the shop page, located at `/content/1-shop/shop.en.txt`. This includes defining your shipping methods, tax rates, user permissions, and payment details.

Your shop logo and theme options are defined in the site options, located at `/content/site.en.txt`.

Of course, there are helpful blueprints so you can easily manage everything from the panel.

Once your site goes public, you'll need to enter your license keys in the `/site/config/config.php` file.

## Upgrading from v1.0.3

If you're upgrading from Shopkit 1.0.3 or earlier, note that the location of the `Register` page has changed, and a new page called `Reset` has been introduced. The new folder structure looks like this:

```
content/
    account/
        register/
        reset/
```

## Upgrading from v0.9

If you're upgrading from Shopkit 0.9.2 or earlier, you'll have to change some things manually:

- The old Shop page was located at `/content/3-shop`. It has now been changed to `/content/1-shop`. After pulling the updated repo, move your categories and products from `3-shop` to `1-shop`, then delete the `3-shop` directory.
- Since Shopkit is now multilingual, change all your text filenames to something like `.en.txt`.
- In every product's text file, change `Prices:` to `Variants:`.
- In every order's text file, change the order status values to reflect the new values: `pending`, `paid`, or `shipped`.
